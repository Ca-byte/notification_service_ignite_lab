## üíª Project

This project aims to create and manage a notifications microservice in an organized and well-structured way.
We learned the particularities of the NestJS framework integrated with Prisma such as ORM, domain, use cases, business rules, SOLID and automated tests, we connected all layers of our application, we created routes, controllers, validations.
In addition to working with the NestJS dependency injection concept, we learned the factory concept.

:fire: In the After Ignite Lab extra class, we were introduced to Asynchronous Communication using Apache Kafka.

Speechless for the quality of the event!
